# Extended-Secondary-School-Leaving-Certificate-1-Calculation-Programm

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of our Software Development course in school, representing our first real-world programming challenge. The program validates whether a student has achieved the Extended Secondary School Leaving Certificate 1 (Erweiterter Sekundarabschluss I / ESE) based on their grades.

## Project Context

**Course:** Software Development  
**Language:** Java  
**Team Structure:** Groups of 3  
**Individual Requirement:** Despite working in teams, each member had to write their own implementation

### The Challenge

Our teacher took on a unique approach for this project - "disguising" himself as someone with no technical knowledge and avoiding all technical questions. The process worked as follows:

1. Conducted problem analysis within our groups
2. Sat down in plenum (full class session) for a question round
3. Could ask non-technical questions only
4. Received no help with technical implementation details

This meant we had to:
- Apply only what we had already learned in class (no internet research allowed)
- Problem-solve without direct teacher guidance on code
- Collaborate within our teams to understand the problem
- Develop our own solutions from scratch

## How It Works

The program evaluates student grades according to the official requirements for the Extended Secondary School Leaving Certificate 1:
- Checks grade distribution across subjects
- Validates main subject performance
- Ensures overall grade average meets standards
- Determines eligibility for the certificate

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans) or command line

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codewithcay/Extended-Secondary-School-Leaving-Certificate-1-Calculation-Programm.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Extended-Secondary-School-Leaving-Certificate-1-Calculation-Programm
```

3. Compile the Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
```

4. Run the program:
```bash
java Main
```

## Usage

**Note:** This program implements the base calculations for the Extended Secondary School Leaving Certificate 1 requirements. As this was our first project of this kind, it may not include all the comprehensive calculations needed for a complete certification check, but it demonstrates the fundamental logic and approach.

1. Start the program
2. Enter student grades for each subject
3. The program will calculate and display:
   - Whether the student qualifies for the Extended Secondary School Leaving Certificate 1
   - Which requirements are met/not met
   - Detailed breakdown of results

## Learning Outcomes

This project taught us:
- **Problem Analysis:** Breaking down real-world requirements into code
- **Team Collaboration:** Working together while maintaining individual implementations
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Structuring a Java application
- **Testing & Validation:** Ensuring our calculations match official standards
- **Self-Reliance:** Solving problems without direct teacher assistance

## Collaboration Approach

While we worked in teams of three, each member:
- Developed their own unique code implementation
- Shared insights and problem-solving strategies
- Helped teammates understand the requirements
- Maintained individual responsibility for their solution

## License

This project was created for educational purposes as part of our school curriculum.
